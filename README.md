# Tic-tac-toe-Game
 A Tic Tac Toe game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with both Player vs Player and Player vs Computer modes. The computer follows a rule-based strategy (win, block, center, corner, side). This project helped me understand turn-based logic, state handling, and debugging real game edge cases.
